# ROS Installs

This repository contains [wstool](https://github.com/vcstools/wstool) "rosinstall" files for the 
Personal Robotics Lab: related groups of packages installed from source control, usually used in
the context of a [catkin](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin) workspace.

## How-To

### Workspace Setup

`wstool` may be used for any kind of project, but is particularly relevant for catkin `src` folders.

1. Install wstools with `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python-wstool` or 
`pip install wstool` if you have not already
1. Create a workspace

        mkdir -p my_workspace/src
        cd my_workspace/src
        catkin_init_workspace # optionally init catkin workspace
        wstool init # init .rosinstall file

We use `https://` for repositories to make it easier to checkout on multiple machines that may not have
ssh keys setup. To ease mass checkouts and updates, you may want to enable git credential caching with:
```
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=120'
```

Using `git@github...` for repositories allows you to take advantage of ssh keys. If you are using
the rosinstall files on your own PC you may use the included converter script to switch back and
forth:
```
convert --to-ssh some.rosinstall
convert --to-https some.rosinstall
```
If you do not have you keys setup please see [GitHub's how-to](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)
or ask your system administrator.
### Add External `*.rosinstall` Files to Your Project

To use the rosinstall files, check this repository out (e.g. to `~/pr-rosinstalls`), then execute the following after running `wstool init` in your workspace src folder:
```
# add all herbpy repositories to your .rosinstall without duplicates
wstool merge ~/pr-rosinstalls/herb-minimal-sim.rosinstall
wstool up # update/clone your .rosinstall repositories
```

### Add Additional Repositories to Your Project

To add an repository to your project's `.rosinstall` file, run the following after `wstool init`:
```
# add repository to .rosinstall
wstool set some_repo https://github.com/user/some_repo.git --git
wstool up # update/clone your .rosinstall repositories
```

### Add New PRL `*.rosinstall` File

Before committing a new file, make sure there is not already a rosinstall file that
covers your workspace but under a name you did not expect.

1. Prepare a new **clean** workspace

        mkdir -p new_workspace/src
        cd new_workspace/src
        wstool init
1. Install all repositories and verify it works as desired

        wstool set repo1 https://github.com/user/repo1.git --git 
        ... # repeat for all repos
        wstool up
    * prefer `https://` to ease multi-system setups, you may use the converter script to convert before committing
1. Rename `.rosinstall` to something meaningful before committing

        cp .rosinstall ~/pr-rosinstall/skynet.rosinstall
